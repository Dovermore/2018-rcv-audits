--- NOTES IN REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER ---

Sat 09 Feb 2019

    Pulled Zara's PR with change to rcv.py so that it works
    using tallies (dicts mapping ballots to counts) rather than
    ballot lists.

    Phone call with Ron and Zara:

        Agreed to proceed with project

        Goals:
        
            (1) Revise rcv.py code to compute winners
                based on "tally dicts" (mapping tuples (ballots)
                to real numbers) rather than on "ballot lists".
                This is for efficiency.
        
            (2) Revise audit_me.py code to based auditing on
                use of Dirichlet-multinomial code rather than
                on use of Polya's Urn.  This is also for efficiency.
                Perhaps this portion could be replaced by bptool
                or the like.

            (3) Run experiments with revised codebase and Maine election
                data provided by Deb McDonough.
